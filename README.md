# EASI LIFT ![Easi_Lift_logo](https://github.com/Serinajefthas/Easi_Lift/assets/95409426/3231cff5-4463-41eb-ba96-8a8caba3aa0b)

This is my final project for my ALX Software Engineering course! Easi Lift is a lift-sharing web based application using Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL. I wanted to learn a new langauge and framework(s) so I decided Ruby and Rails was a good option for its relevance, as well as Bootstrap for some CSS and HTML styling. Easi Lift was designed as a way for members in my local community to offer rides and book rides from other members in the community, instead of waiting for more expensive ubers to arrive or accept their requests. It prevents members having to scroll through numerous messages in various social media groups trying to find others offering or needing lifts.

## Funtionalities
Since my specialisation was Backend, my focus was on backend features rather than frontend UI and design. Some of my features included:
- MVC architecture: Model View Controller structure for an effecient, modular codebase
- User Authentication: Sign up feature for new users, Login for existing ones, Forget password and Updating profile
- CRUD features: Creating new lifts, Shwoing/Reading avaliable lifts, Updating and Deleting current lifts
- Database active storage: Utilises Rails' Active Record feature to manage data storage and accessibility between Models and Postresql databases
- Associations: using Ruby associations allowed me to prevent users from booking their own lifts and other users from editing and deleting others lifts

## Technologies
- Programming languages: Ruby, HTMl and some JS and CSS
- Framework: Rails
- Styling and UI components: Bootstrap
- ORM: Active Record built into Rails
- RESTful API
- User management: Devise Ruby Gem
- Database: PostgreSQL
- CI/CD: Git and GitHub
